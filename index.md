# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals]https://github.com/judajuded2012/Linear-Regression-project)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**51%** accuracy](https://github.com/judajuded2012/Linear-Regression-project).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/judajuded2012/Logestic-regression)

<img src="images/PB.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify whether client has subscribed the term deposit or not [**88%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/judajuded2012/Logestic-regression).

- Used logistic regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscription depending on selected important features.
- Used SMOTE to handle imbalanced data.
- Explored a machine learning approach to Marketing Analysis.

[Orthopedic Patients Prediction](https://github.com/judajuded2012/Orthopedic-Patient-Prediction)

<img src="images/PB.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, KNN

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters according to that I classified whether the patients are Normal or Abnormal.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify whether the patient is normal or abnormal [**83.5%** accuracy using KNN algorithm](https://github.com/judajuded2012/Orthopedic-Patient-Prediction).

- Used K-Nearest-Neighbors and GaussianNB to classify Normal or Abnormal paitents.
- Analysed different parameters to classify patients. 
- Explored a machine learning approach to Medical Analysis.

[Hand Written Digits Recognization](https://github.com/judajuded2012/Hand_Writing_Recognation)

<img src="images/HW.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Mnist is a dataset with 70,000 of hand written digits. Here I have predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Nural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**98.59%** using **10** epochs](https://github.com/judajuded2012/Hand_Writing_Recognation).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers.
- Training model with MNIST data.
- Fitting the CNN to recognize hand written digits.
- Data Source: MNIST

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Cat_or_Dog_prediction/blob/main/CNN_Project%20(Image_Classification).ipynb)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**80%** using **23** epochs](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Cat_or_Dog_prediction/blob/main/CNN_Project%20(Image_Classification).ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
